# Hello, I'm Gustavo Arana Osorio

---

## I'm a Systems Engineer, Computer Security Specialist, and Full-stack developer in Genexus from Colombia. Iiving on the "Tierrita" it's small town call Buga in Valle del Cauca, where I was born and raised. I have more than 10 years of experience in consulting, development projects, and integrations with accounting software.

## Genexus is a great tool. **I used to say "why learn native if we have Genexus?"**, but I was wrong. However, it's never too late to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and that's why I'm here.
