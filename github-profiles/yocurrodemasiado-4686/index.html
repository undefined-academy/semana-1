<h1>Welcome to my GitHub profile! </h1>

<h3>About me</h3> 

<p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Ceci</strong>. I'm from <strong>Spain</strong> and I'm studying at University to be a primary teacher. I live in <strong>Toledo</strong>, an old, 
    beatiful and small city close to Madrid. </p>
    
<p> I have two dogs: <strong>Zero</strong> (a greyhound) and <strong>Roma</strong> (a maremma sheepdog). 
    Both of them are really special (I imagine everybody says that about their dogs, though). </p>

<p> I started teaching educative robotics and programming to children, and I became interested in the 
    developer world. I've just finished a <strong>Web Design Bootcamp</strong> based in Javasript and Vue, and I'm starting a new one, this time 
    related with fullstack developing. This GitHub profile is an exercise of this new bootcamp indeed.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to learn more about programming because I love it! </p>

<h3>Bootcamp Exercise 1</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ls</td>
      <td>Show all the files in the current folder</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cd</td>
        <td>We move between folders</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>mkdir + folder_name</td>
        <td>Creates a new folder with the name that we give to the command</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>rm</td>
        <td>It deletes a file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>mv</td>
        <td>We can use it to move a file from a folder to another, or to rename a file</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>
