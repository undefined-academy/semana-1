# **ALEXANDRA SALAZAR D**
>## _Kniting code and coding therapy._
I'm a web developer. I'm a cat lover who enjoys music, movies, and crocheting. I'm good at listening to people and working in a team. I believe that helping others makes the world a more beautiful place, and that making an effort to care for the planet has an impact.

I have knowledge in **frontend development** with **React.js**, acquired at <Laboratoria>, an intensive programming bootcamp where I not only gained basic knowledge but also developed many **personal skills**. During the bootcamp, I worked on real projects using **agile methodologies**. After completing the bootcamp, I have continued my learning independently through various means, including new projects, courses, and certifications. **Learning new things is my passion**.

I was an occupational therapist until 2020, when the pandemic and some personal issues made me reconsider my career path, and I discovered that programming was much more than a hobby and now **I am hopelessly in love with code**.
