    <p>
      I'm a web developer. I'm a cat lover who enjoys music, movies, and crocheting. I'm good at listening to people and working in a team. I believe that helping others makes the world a more beautiful place, and that making an effort to care for the planet has an impact.

    </p>
    <p>
      I have knowledge in <strong>frontend development</strong> with <strong>React.js</strong>, acquired at <Laboratoria>, an intensive programming bootcamp where I not only gained basic knowledge but also developed many <strong>personal skills</strong>. During the bootcamp, I worked on real projects using <strong>agile methodologies</strong>. After completing the bootcamp, I have continued my learning independently through various means, including new projects, courses, and certifications. <strong>Learning new things is my passion</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was an occupational therapist until 2020, when the pandemic and some personal issues made me reconsider my career path, and I discovered that programming was much more than a hobby and now<strong> I am hopelessly in love with code</strong>.

  <h1>Terminal Command</h1>
  <p>
    The next tables are a coding exercise for <strong>Undefined Academy Full Stack Bootcamp</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    My favourite Terminal commands:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Command</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>ls-la</td>
        <td>Lists the directory elements, even the hidden ones</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>mkdir</td>
        <td>Creates a new directory</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>touch</td>
        <td>Creates a new file</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>rm -i</td>
        <td>Removes a file asking before do it</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>rm -r</td>
        <td>Removes a directory</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>pwd</td>
        <td>Prints the actual route</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>code .</td>
        <td>Opens a new VScode session with the actual file</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>clear</td>
        <td>Cleans the content printed in the screen</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2>Practical Alias</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes we want to save time when coding, so, we can asign some short alias to the commands in order to do it, there are some of my own:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <th>Alias</th>
      <th>Command</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>cl: 'clear'</td>
        <td>Cleans the screen</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>findir: 'ls ~/ \| grep $1'</td>
        <td>Find a coincident directory</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>run: 'npm run dev'</td>
        <td>Runs a development server in local host in Vite</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>start: 'npm run start'</td>
        <td>Runs a development server in local host in JS and CRA</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
