        I'm a cat lover who enjoys music, movies, and crocheting. I'm good at
        listening to people and working in a team. I believe that helping others
        makes the world a more beautiful place, and that making an effort to
        care for the planet has an impact.
      </p>

        I have knowledge in <strong>frontend development</strong> with
        <strong>React.js</strong>, acquired at Laboratoria, an intensive
        programming bootcamp where I not only gained basic knowledge but also
        developed many <strong>personal skills</strong>. During the bootcamp, I
        worked on real projects using <strong>agile methodologies</strong>.
        After completing the bootcamp, I have continued my learning
        independently through different ways, including new projects, courses,
        and certifications. <strong>Learning new things is my passion</strong>.

        I was an occupational therapist until 2020, when the pandemic and some
        personal issues made me reconsider my career path, and I discovered that
        programming was much more than a hobby and now<strong>
          I am hopelessly in love with code</strong
        >.

      <h1>Terminal Commands</h1>
      <p>My favourite Terminal commands:</p>
      <pre>
    <code>
      <table border='1'>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Command</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>ls-la</td>
            <td>Lists the directory elements, even the hidden ones</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>mkdir</td>
            <td>Creates a new directory</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>touch</td>
            <td>Creates a new file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>rm -i</td>
            <td>Removes a file asking before do it</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>rm -r</td>
            <td>Removes a directory</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>pwd</td>
            <td>Prints the actual route</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>code .</td>
            <td>Opens a new VScode session with the actual file</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>clear</td>
            <td>Cleans the content printed in the screen</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </code>
  </pre>
      <h2>Practical Alias</h2>
      <p>
        Want to save time when coding? Then asign some short alias to the
        commands in order to do it, there are some of my own:
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
      <table border='1'>
        <thead>
          <th>Alias</th>
          <th>Command</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>cl: 'clear'</td>
            <td>Cleans the screen</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>findir: 'ls ~/ \| grep $1'</td>
            <td>Find a coincident directory</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>run: 'npm run dev'</td>
            <td>Runs a development server in local host in Vite</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>start: 'npm run start'</td>
            <td>Runs a development server in local host in JS and CRA</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </code>
