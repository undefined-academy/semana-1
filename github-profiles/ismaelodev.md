## Alias

An alias in a terminal is a shortcut for a command or a sequence of commands.

First useful alias:

```sh
//This alias will create a shortcut named ll that is equivalent to the command ls -l

alias ll='ls -l'
```

Second useful alias:

```sh
//This alias is equivalent to the command ping -c 4 google.com:

alias pingy='ping -c 4 google.com'

```

## Thanks! 🙏🏽
