## Linux

On Linux you can find commands for different actions, as shown on the next table:

| Command              | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **command** _--help_ | Shows the information about the **command** typed.                                                  |
| _ls_                 | Lists information about the files on the current directory by default.                              |
| _cd_                 | Changes the shell working directory.                                                                |
| _pwd_                | Prints the name of the current working directory.                                                   |
| _cal_                | Shows a calendar on text mode in the console.                                                       |
| _df_                 | Shows information about the file system on which each file resides, or all file systems by default. |

### Aliases on Linux

To create aliases on Linux you need to use the command _alias_.

For example, to create an alias for the command _clear_:

```sh
alias cl="clear"
```

In the next table we can see some recommended aliases for Linux:

| Alias | Command          |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| cl    | alias cl='clear' |
| rm    | alias rm='trash' |
