# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sebastian Boari
## As a software development student, I am very excited to put everything I learn into practice and document my progress.

I am currently learning and practicing to become a full-stack web developer. I am **Frontend ReactJS developer** and I live in Argentina. I am currently studying a Higher Technician in Programming.
