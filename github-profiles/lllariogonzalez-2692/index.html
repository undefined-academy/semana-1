                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Previously I worked as an audiovisual producer, graphic designer and sound engineer, also as an
                    administrator, but I have always been passionate about technology and today I am in search of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about technology and web development, I am good at both the client side (Front End)
                    and
                    the
                    server side (Back End). I have acquired knowledge to develop end-to-end solutions, from the database
                    to
                    the
                    user interface. I am committed to code quality, including test automation to ensure the stability of
                    my
                    solutions and I always try to follow good programming practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an effective <b>communicator</b> and able to work <b>collaboratively</b> in a team to
                    <b>solve problems</b> and meet project requirements. I am also <b>adaptable</b>
                    and committed to <b>continuous learning</b> to keep up with the latest trends and
                    technologies in my field.

                    If you want to know a little more about me or have a project that might interest me, drop me a line.
