# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ariel Ferreiro
### I am a software engineer from Argentina graduated in [Belgrano University ](https://ub.edu.ar/). I have more than 20 years of experience in IT. I have a good background in Python and experience in mobile development in Flutter and IOS native. 

## My favourite Linux commands

| Command      | Description                                 |
| -----------  | ------------------------------------------- |
| clear        | Clears the screen                           |
| ls           | List the directory folders and files        |
| pwd          | Allows me to check where I am located       |
| cat          | Shows the content of a file                 |

Before the bootcamp I didnt know that we could create aliases for most used commands. I already created some for git and npm.

```sh
alias ga='git add .'
alias npms='npm start'
```

This is my git: [Ariel Ferreiro's GIT](https://github.com/ArielFerreiro).
