### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### **About Me**

Hi there! My name is Johanss, and I'm 34 years old. I live in Spain and currently work as a sales assistant at Madrid-Barajas Airport. However, I have decided to switch careers and pursue programming. Although I'm just a beginner, I'm eager to learn as much as I can about this exciting field.

I have a 4-year-old daughter and three pets - two dogs and a cat - that bring me joy and adventure. I'm also an amateur boxer, although I can't do it professionally anymore due to some injuries.

I'm originally from Venezuela, but I moved to Spain when I was 19 in search of new opportunities. Since then, I've worked hard to build a life here, and now I'm excited to start a new chapter in my career.

Recently, I've been studying some JavaScript on my own, and I'm excited to continue learning more about this language and other programming languages. I'm highly motivated by the possibility of exploring new opportunities and developing skills in a field that I'm passionate about.

In summary, I'm a programming enthusiast with a strong desire to learn and improve. I'm excited to see where this new adventure takes me and hope to keep learning and growing in this field.
