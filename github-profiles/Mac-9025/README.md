# Hey, what's up!!

## I'm Mauricio Coronado ##

## I'm a project management engineer ##
from the construction area with civil, hydraulic and paviment engineering knowledge, now learning new skills in the programming.
***
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other related languages...

I aim to secure a job in this field and apply my newly acquired skills.
I'm thrilled about the opportunities that lie ahead and eager to put into practice all that I have learned.

Thanks to **Guillermo Rodas** and his ***Full-Stack Javascript Bootcamp*** for this oportunity.
