# 🧑🏽About me:
## 👋 Hi, I'm Luis Angel Arroyo
### 🧑🏽‍💻 A computer systems engineer from Mexico.

📖 I'm currently learning Javascript Full-stack on my own and collaborating with other colleagues in the reengineering of the CIMPS congress website.

🦉 I love challenges that can push me to learn new things and improve my skills. In my free time, I like to solve logic problems like the ones that can be found on the HackerRank website.

🔍 I actively seek opportunities that will bring me more knowledge and skills. I am willing to commit 100% to any project that aligns with my career goals.

📒 My native language is Spanish, and I am currently perfecting my English level through language courses and practice.

### 📚 Five Linux commands I learned in the first bootcamp class

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ls 	            | Lists the contents of a directory                 |
| cd 	            | Change the current working directory              |
| pwd 	            | Print the current working directory               |
| mkdir             | Create a new directory                            |
| whoami            | Display the username of the current user          |
