    <h1>Hi there👋, I'm <strong>Oliver Pinto</strong></h1>
    <h3><em>a Frontend developer</em></h3>

<p>I'm a <span class="bold curly">frontend developer</span> and a <span class="bold">programming👨‍💻 enthusiast</span> from Argentina. I've focused on frontend development and acquired skills through a **self-taught💪** journey. My passion for technology and problem-solving has led me to familiarize myself with key languages and tools such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React.</p>

<p>Even though I'm still in the learning process, I've demonstrated a great ability to apply my knowledge to practical projects. Being from Argentina, I bring a unique perspective and am eager to contribute to the global tech community.</p>
