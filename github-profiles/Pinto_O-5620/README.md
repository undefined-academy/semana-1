# Hi there👋, I'm **Oliver Pinto**
### _**a Frontend developer**_

I'm a **frontend developer** and a _programming👨‍💻 enthusiast_ from Argentina. I've focused on frontend development and acquired skills through a **self-taught💪** journey. My passion for technology and problem-solving has led me to familiarize myself with key languages and tools such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React.

Even though I'm still in the learning process, I've demonstrated a great ability to apply my knowledge to practical projects. Being from Argentina, I bring a unique perspective and am eager to contribute to the global tech community.
