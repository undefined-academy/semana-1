# Hi 👋, I'm Sandra

## ✨About me

My name is **Sandra Álvaro**. I'm 27 years old and I'm from Madrid, Spain. 

I've always liked the programming world and a few months ago I decided to make it my profession. So I want to become a FullStack developer 💻.

I am self-taught in different technologies such as HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

Right now I'm taking the *Full-stack JavaScript Bootcamp* at Undefined Academy.

## 📖Skills I would like to learn

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Git y GitHub
- Tailwind
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- SQL
- Python

### Five Linux commands I learned in the Bootcamp.
| Command  | Description                                        | 
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| *cd*     | Change directory.                                  |
| *pwd*    | Shows you the path to the directory you are in.    |
| *mkdir*  | Create a new folder with its name.                 |
| *ls*     | List the files in the folder where you are located.|
| *rm*     | Allows us to delete a file.                        |

### Two aliases that may be useful for Linux.
