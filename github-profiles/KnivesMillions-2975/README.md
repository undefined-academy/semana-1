# Hello, I'm Christian Florez,
## I'm a **QA Trainee** from Colombia.

### As a self-taught QA Trainee, I have developed a strong passion for software testing and quality assurance.

My interest in this field stems from my desire to ensure that software is functioning as intended and meeting user requirements. Additionally, I am also interested in Fullstack Development, and I have been exploring various tools and frameworks to expand my skill set.
