|  touch  | Whit this command I can **create** new files                                                         |
|   cat   | I can **preview** my file in the terminal, but this is only _for files with text_                    |
|   pwd   | I use the _zsh theme_ **awesomepanda** and whit this command I can view my current working directory |
