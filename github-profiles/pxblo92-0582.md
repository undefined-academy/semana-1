Welcome to my [GitHub Profile Page](https://github.com/pblpz92)

## I like **Java**ðŸŸ â˜• and **Spring**ðŸŸ¢ðŸŒ¿ and I'm aiming to become better and better at OOP  and java backend development.

### In this GitHub profile You will find repos like:
- **Learning JPA**: This repo is a project I did about a school management system for [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/hibernate-jpa-tutorial-for-beginners-in-100-steps/).

- **Learning SQL**: Practice querys from the book O'Reilly's book [Learning SQL by Alan Beaulieu](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-sql-3rd/9781492057604/).

- **100 Algorithm challenge**: I was curious about TypeScript and also wanted to get better at resolving algorithms so I did [this 100 algorithm challenge](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/100-algorithms-challenge/10000DIVC2022170/) on TypeScript.


And there will be more, **the best is yet to come!**
