### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# This is Ramiro Reynoso
### I'm eager to learn everything I can about Software Development and hope to be able to take part of this great community.
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=none)](https://github.com/RamaUB)

I am currently a **Systems Analyst** and future **Information Systems Graduate**, living, studying and working in _Buenos Aires, Argentina_.

 âœ¨ My programming knowledge is quite wide and involves the following: 
- Java 
- Html
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Python
- R 
- C#, 
(_and more_).

Although not currently working IT, I still dedicate a lot of time to it and consider it, above anything, a Hobby and a future escape.

##### âš¡ Anyways, I am now experimenting with Terminal commands and following is a list of those which you may find useful:
#

| Terminal Command  |   Description     |
|---|---|
| mv  | Used to move files or rename files |
| mkdir| Used to create new directories|
| cd | Used to change the current directory |
| rm | Used to remove (delete) a file  |
| cp| Used to copy files |

##### ðŸŒ± Also, my favorite ___aliases___ for Terminal commands are these:
#

| Aliases  |   Description     |
|---|---|
| cls  | A shorter way to call clear command _(1)_|
| finda | A quick way to **find** **a**ny file from the root _(2)_|

###### _(1)_ `alias cls="clear"` 
###### _(2)_ `alias finda="ls ~/ | grep $1"`

#
That's all for now!
