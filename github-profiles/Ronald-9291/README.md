  ### I am going to attach a table with commands that I have seen that can be used in the terminal.


|                                    Command                                  |                                Command function                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alias download="youtube-dl -f bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3  | Use the download command to download a youtube audio using youtube-dl. |
| alias mkdircd='function _mkdircd(){ mkdir -p "$1"; cd "$1"; };_mkdircd'     | create a directory and access it at once                               |
| alias ip="curl icanhazip.com"                                               | Know our public ip from the terminal with the ip command.              |
| alias .1="cd ..                                                             | .1 to go up 1 level in the directory structure.                        |
| alias grep="grep --color=auto"                                              | So that grep will highlight the matching word.                         |


## At the moment I don't have the most used commands but I am going to list here two that seem interesting to me.

```bash
alias download="youtube-dl -f bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
```
```bash
 alias grep="grep --color=auto" 
 ```
