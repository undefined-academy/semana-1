# Hello, I'm Martin Vargas ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a student of the **UNDEFINED ACADEMY** free Bootcamp to become a **Full-stack JavaScript Developer**.

### I share some Ubuntu terminal commands that I have learned:

| Command | Description                                                               |
| :------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sudo    | It is used before a command is executed as **root** or **administrator**. |
| ls      | Show the current directory.                                               |
| mkdir   | Create a directory.                                                       |
| rm      | Remove file.                                                              |
| mv      | Move file.                                                                |

### Now I share some useful alias commands:

```bash
alias findd="ls ~/ | grep $1"
```

**We can use this alias to filter folders in our directory.**

```bash
alias updateos="sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y"
```

**Executing this command we can update the OS.**

```bash
alias mkdircd='function _mkdircd(){ mkdir -p "$1"; cd "$1"; };_mkdircd'
```

**Create a directory and access it directly.**
