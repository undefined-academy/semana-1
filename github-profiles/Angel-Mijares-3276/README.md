## Full Stack Js Student ðŸ’£

Hello, i'm **Angel Mijares**. Actually living in **Maracay, Venezuela**, i'm 27 years old. Since I was little I have always been attracted to technology, despite never being able to afford a degree as such, I never put it aside, I knew that at some point I could learn. And here I am, many years later, preparing to be a full stack developer.

Here I show a little of what I have learned so far in this bootcamp ðŸ’Ž
