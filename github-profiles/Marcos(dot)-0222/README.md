# Hello, I'm Marcos Viejo 🖐🏻
## This is a briefly description about me
### I'm a **lawyer** and working as **Productivy Manager** at the present

I always love computing and I like to learn by myself a lot of things related to this computing's world.
I am really interested in topics such as internet, hardware, software, coding, among others.

🌱Currently learning at **Javascript Full-Stack Bootcamp** that is going to be my first time with this topic so I am really excited about it!

## Curious and excited about the future 🙌🏻
