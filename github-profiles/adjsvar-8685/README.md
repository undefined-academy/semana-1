Hi there!, I am a self-taught software development student, focused mostly in the web area. I have worked with technologies such as **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), Python, SQL, and React.** Although I love the frontend, my goal is to be proficient in the backend technologies as well.

Actually i'm following the Javascript Fullstack Bootcamp from Guillermo Rodas and here is my homework:

5 Most used commands:

| Command |          Description                |
| ------  |       -----------------             |
|   ls    |  List files in the actual directory |
|   cd    |  Change the directory               |
|  mkdir  |  Create a new directory             |
|  touch  |  Create a new file                  |
|  pwd    |  Prints the actual directory        |

Usefull Alias:

| Alias      | Description                         |
| -----      | -----------                         |
| c="code ." | Open vscode in the actual directory |
| cf="touch" | same as touch                       |
