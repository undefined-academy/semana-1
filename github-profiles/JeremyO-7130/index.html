    <h1>Hi! I'm Jeremy 🙋🏻🇪🇨</h1>

    <h2>A brief description about me</h2>

    <p>I am a self-taught student who spent some time in college, passionate about technology and love for learning, especially about <strong>web development</strong>🧑🏻‍💻. I am fascinated to observe all the <em>functionality</em> and <em>aesthetics</em> of an application when I have finished it.</p>

    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> has become my go-to tool for most of my projects (although <em>Python</em> is out there watching us 👀).</p>

    <p>Anyway, I'm currently learning <strong>React</strong> ⚛️, I find it a delight to use, so I'm constantly improving myself and working hard to master it as well as other dominant technologies. I want to become a competent <em>full-stack</em> developer capable of making incredible products, and I will get there 💪🏼</p>
