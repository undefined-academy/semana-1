    <h1>Hola todos, Soy Christian J. Amaguaña</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>
      I am frontend developer. I have experience working Front-End frameworks,
      as well as Database administrator and customer service. I have worked in
      agile teams with Scrum. I do like new challenges and I am always ready to
      face new projects as well as learn about software development. I am person
      who is looking to learn something new everyday, and to put in practice my
      knowledge about software development and managment databases. I know that
      team work is an important part in building and succeeding of projects, as
      communication and feedback are essential when working, as well as to grow
      as a person and a professional.
